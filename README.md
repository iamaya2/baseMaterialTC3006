# Demo repo for the TC3006 course
This repository is a demo of what is expected to deliver on each repository requested for the TC3006 course at Tecnológico de Monterrey. For this demo, we consider the *implementation portfolio* deliverable, which spans across two modules (Statistics and ML) and two subcompetencies (SMA0101A and SMA0401A). Also, we assume that the repository is being provided at the end of first block, which means that the students already got some feedback from the professors.
